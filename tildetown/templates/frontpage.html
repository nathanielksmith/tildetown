  <h2>what is the tilde.town?</h2>
  <p>tilde.town is an intentional community focused on <b>radical inclusivity</b> and the <b>creation of digital art</b>. We strive to create a place that is open to people of all backgrounds and technical ability and strive together to make beautiful works of art that can be conveyed via the web.</p>
 <h2>how do i join tilde.town?</h2>

  <h2>what isn't tilde.town?</h2>
  <p>it's never super fun to define stuff in a negative sense, but there has been a lot of confusion around what tilde.town is and isn't. tilde.town is <i>not</i> a startup. it is <i>not</i> commercial in any way. tilde.town, as a side effect, has features of a social network but it is not intended to be the "next" anything (except maybe geocities or angelfire). tilde.town is <b>not</b> <a href="http://tilde.club">tilde.club</a> but is inspired by it.</p>
 <h2>who is tilde.town?</h2>
<p>tilde.town is made up of its members. we are a group of creative folk
interested in peer education and digital art. the founder is <a
href="http://tilde.town/~vilmibm">~vilmibm</a> whom you are more than welcome to
talk at via <a href="https://twitter.com/nate_smith">twitter</a> or <a
href="mailto:nathanielksmith@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
 <h2>why tilde.town?</h2>
<p>making websites is harder than ever; everything that
can be commercialized is being commercialized; knowledge is being carved up and
locked away for profit; software is increasingly proprietary and bloated.
tilde.town is an experiment in reclaiming a bygone era of low-barrier,
judgement-free, low stakes expression with a focus on low-tech art and
pseudonymous creation.</p>

<h2>tilde town news</h2>

<h3>donations! also, new disk</h3>
<p><sub><em>Wed Apr 29 06:04:58 UTC 2015</em></sub></p> <p>An exciting day for
tilde.town. We now have way to donate via <a
href="https://www.patreon.com/nathanielksmith">patreon</a>. Thanks to all the
folx who have already become patrons! y'all make the heart of this sysadmin
warm and fuzz. A big part of the push for donations was a need for more server
space which we have as of tonight's server upgrade/reboot. The main tilde.town
server now has a 40gb disk. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Some updates coming down the pipe:
<ul>
 <li>2gb quota for all users</li>
 <li>fixed poetry server</li>
 <li>better signup process/docs</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>welcome haiku</h3>
<p><sub><em> Thu Mar  5 21:19:42 UTC 2015</em></sub></p>
<p>If you signed up in the last two months or so you had a bum welcome present
in your /home. the script has been fixed and now everyone retroactively has a
welcome haiku in their home directory. enjoy.</p>

<h3>server restart</h3>
<p><sub><em>Tue Jan 27 21:13:27 UTC 2015</em></sub></p>
<p>Hi. Today tilde.town had to restart to pick up a patch for <a
href="http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/276">CVE 2015-0235</a>.
data.tilde.town (our poetry server) has also been patched and restated. Sorry
for any inconvenience!</p>

<h3>lots of people</h3>
<p><sub><em>Thu Jan  1 07:37:16 UTC 2015</em></sub></p>
<p>we have ~370 users. isn't that wild?</p>

<h3>Scheduled Downtime Tonight</h3>
<p><sub><em>Wed Nov 26 21:19:12 UTC 2014</em></sub></p>

<p>To accommodate our growing user base, there will be a server resize/reboot
tonight (Pacific time). Sadly I cannot give an exact time as I still don't have
internet at my new place and will have to opportunistically find some to
execute this upgrade.</p>
<p>The server should only be down for a few minutes, but this will terminate
any running applications (like tmux/screen/irssi). Any files open in an editor
should be preserved by a swap file but you still may want to save and close
things in the next several hours.</p>
<p>Also, this upgrade means that tilde.town is no longer an essentially free
project, so I may put up something for donations soon.</p>

<h3>100+ users party report</h3>
<p><sub><em>Sun Nov  9 23:07:08 UTC 2014</em></sub></em>
<p>tilde.town now has 102 users. We crossed into three digits last night and
lots of townies hung out in irc to celebrate. Some new features even
launched!</p>

<ul>
  <li>the homepage userlist is now sorted by modified time</li>

<h3>80 users!</h3>
<p><sub><em>Wed Oct 29 18:19:45 UTC 2014</em></sub></em>

<p>tilde.town just added its 80th user. Welcome! Some folks have been having
trouble with ssh public keys. Remember, public keys are really confusing if you
aren't too familiar with them, and there is no judgement if you can't
immediately get them to work. Feel free to tweet at <a
href="https://twitter.com/tildetown">@tildetown</a> or send an email to <a
href="mailto:nks@lambdaphil.es">~vilmibm</a> if you'd like some help.</p>

</p>

<h3>60 users</h3>
<p><sub><em>Sat Oct 25 19:37:47 UTC 2014</em></sub></em>
<p>tilde.town is up to 60 users. This is lovely! It is also only a tenth of our
planned total user capacity, so if you are interested in a tilde* account we'd
love to have you. You can even submit a user request with a fancy form now!</p>

<h3>Change of IP, warnings when you ssh</h3>
<p><sub><em>Sun Oct 19 03:28:59 UTC 2014</em></sub></p>
<p>
  In the interest of making sure we don't suddenly disappear from the Internet
as a result of a dynamic IP change on AWS I switched to using an Elastic
IP (amusingly, "elastic" IPs are static).
</p>

<p>
The upside is that we now have a static IP (also it's free) (woo).
</p>

<p>
The downside is that when you try to SSH into tilde.town, now, you'll get an
error about "something nasty" and there will be many @ characters. You'll want
to edit your .ssh/known_hosts file and remove the entry for tilde.town (your
error message should have a cute copy-pasta-able one-liner for doing this for
you).
</p>

<p>
Go ahead and do that, and then log in With Confidence. Hopefully this won't happen again.
</p>

<p>
I'll close by mentioning the imminent arrival of many new tildeverse members. We (the tildeverse operators) are just about ready to accept the signups currently languishing in a waitlist. This means lots of new users, which is lovely, but may mean some growing pains while I adapt our server to the new user load in the most cost-effective way.
</p>

 And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?
 And you, paid to defile the People

`` He told me at parting, that he should soon write
 Let me hear from you without delay
 By him she was put in mind of what she might do

 I knew who it came from. The virgin shrieks aloud
 To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer But she was always right.
